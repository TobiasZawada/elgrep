Emacs-Lisp Grep (`elgrep`)
====
Short description
----
Emacs lisp package for searching text matching a given regular expression in a set of files within a user-specified directory.
The files are selected by another regular expression matching the file names.
The directory can optionally be searched recursively.
PDF-files can also be searched but for that purpose the external tool `pdftotext` (or some equivalent program) is required.

Installation
----
Elgrep is available via Melpa. So you can just do `M-x package-install RET` and input `elgrep` as the package to be installed.

Save `elgrep.el` in one of the directories specified in the `load-path` of emacs and
put the following line into your initialization file (e.g., `~/.emacs`):

`(require 'elgrep)`

Usage
----
Open the `elgrep-menu` via menu item "Tools" â†’ "Search files (Elgrep)...".
There are menu items for the directory, the file name regexp for filtering
and the regexp for grepping. Furthermore, you can also switch on recursive grep.

Run <kbd>M-x</kbd> `elgrep` to search a single directory for files with file
name matching a given regular expression for text matching a given
regular expression. With prefix arg <kbd>C-u</kbd> it searches the directory
recursively.
